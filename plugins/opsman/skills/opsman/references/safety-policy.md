# Opsman Safety Policy

## Risk classes

| Class | Meaning | Handling |
| --- | --- | --- |
| R0 | Read-only discovery | automatic |
| R1 | Local generated artifacts (`.opsman/`) | automatic |
| R2 | Source/manifest modification | automatic in worktree, must validate |
| R3 | External non-production side effect | explicit policy or user approval |
| R4 | Production or destructive action | always explicit user approval |

Opsman automatically runs R0–R2 command-backed steps inside the run worktree.
Plan-step risk declaration and command policy enforcement happen before a
command executes. R3/R4 commands require recorded human approval first.

## Deny patterns (escalate to R4 regardless of declared risk)

`kubectl apply`, `kubectl delete`, `terraform apply`, `pulumi up`,
`git push --force`, credential rotation, IAM policy changes, resource
deletion in any live environment.

## Approval flow

R3/R4 → event `HumanApprovalRequired` → state `WAITING_APPROVAL`. The
agent asks the user in conversation; the reply is recorded as an
`ApprovalGranted` event whose payload states who approved what and when. The
matching approval sequence is copied into command evidence before execution.
Plan steps and acceptance checks both pass through this policy path. The audit
trail lives in `events.jsonl` and survives tool switches.

## Approval payload kinds

`ApprovalGranted` payloads declare what was approved:

- `kind: "command"` — an R3/R4 command raised by `run-step`/`validate`:
  `{"kind": "command", "step_id": "...", "command": "...", "effective_risk": "R3|R4", "approver": "...", "approved_at": "..."}`
- `kind: "continuation"` — a human resolving `OracleNeedsHuman` (accepted only
  while the recorded `approval.return_to` is JUDGING):
  `{"kind": "continuation", "approver": "...", "approved_at": "...", "note": "..."}`

Command approvals never fabricate; continuation approvals never name a
command. A payload whose kind does not match the pending wait is refused.
